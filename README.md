# uiRBX
Create a plugin to handle UI development on Roblox

This plugin is still in early development, so most actions are still not implemented.

## Some features
- You can select UI elements by clicking on them (if the `Select` action is enabled)
- You can drag around the plugin anywhere you want, and resize it (in the properties panel)
- Quick position GuiObjects

## Coming soon
- Style management
- Move tool
- Resize tool 
- Color themes
